#ED-OmniGel

Where to view: You can (will soon be able to) view this with more foratting on Github

#Description:

This mod allows you to have a renewable source of various materials.

#Details:

You will need to start by obtaining OmniGel. This is usually done by planting it, waiting for it to grow and then harvesting, it is also possible to acquire it from traders and random crashed escape pods. 
For the next part you will have to research and build the MK1Replicator. There are higher level replicators that you can build to allow you to produce more advanced resources, but the MK1 is the easiest and cheapest to acquire. These are workbenches that allow your colonists to refine the OmniGel that you harvest into usable resources. The MK1 version can only produce slag or rock that will then have to be further refined using the standard methods in Rimworld, but more advanced versions will create usable resources directly.

Recipes:

The following are the resources that are available from the various levels of the replicator.

MK1:
10 OmniGel -> 1 ChunkSlag
10 OmniGel -> 1 ChunkRock 

MK2:
40 OmniGel -> 20 Steel
60 OmniGel -> 15 StoneBlocks
75 OmniGel -> 30 Silver
30 OmniGel -> 1 Gold

MK3:

50 OmniGel -> 5 Uranium

40 OmniGel -> 1 Medicine
